# Weather Station

I made this project in november last year. 
It's a weather station built with arduino that uses an LCD panel and an Adafruit BMP280 module.

## Features

### `Get the temperature`

Get the temperature around the BMP280.

### `Know the pressure`

BMP280 can also read the current pressure (although it's not that accurate)

### `Display data`

The read values are displayed on an LCD panel.

## Details

Built in VSCode with platformIO.
